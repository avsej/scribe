== Advanced Topics

This chapter introduces some techniques topics that you can use to
further extend your Couchbase vocabulary.

=== CAS and Locking

If you need to coordinate shared access on documents, Couchbase helps
you with two approaches. Depending on the application you may need to
use both of them, but in general it is better (if feasible) to lean
towards CAS because it provides the better performance
characteristics.

.Optimistic Locking
Each document has a unique identifier associated with it (the CAS
value), which changes when the document itself is mutated. You can
fetch the CAS value for a given key and pass it to any mutator
operation to protect it. The update will only succeed, when the CAS
value is still the same. This is why it's called optimistic locking.
Someone else can still read and try to update the document, but it
will fail once the CAS value has changed. Here is a example on how to
do it with the Ruby SDK:

[source,ruby]
----
key = "eagle_brewing-golden"
# Reads the document with the CAS value.
beer, flags, cas = client.get(key, :extended => true)

# Updates the document and tries to store it back.
beer["name"] = "Some other Name"
client.set(key, beer, :cas => cas, :flags => flags)
----

Note that this also means that all your application need to follow the
same code path (cooperative locking). If you use `#set` somewhere else
in the code on the same document, it will work even if the CAS itself
is out of date (that's because the normal `#set` method doesn't care
about those values at all). Of course, the CAS itself changes then and
the mutation operation would fail afterwards.

There is also shortcut operation for doing optimistic locking
`Bucket#cas`. Internally it does the same thing but abstract you from
storing and passing meta information. Here is the previous example
rewritten to use this operation:

[source,ruby]
----
key = "eagle_brewing-golden"
client.cas(key) do |beer|
  beer["name"] = "Some other Name"
  # return new value from block
  beer
end
----

Note that you should return new value from the block. If you will skip
it, it will use `"Some other Name"` as new value.

.Pessimistic Locking
If you want to lock a document completely (or an object graph), you
can use the `Bucket#get` operation with `:lock` option. The option
accepts either boolean (where truth does make sense really) or Fixnum
meaning the time period where the lock is valid. The server will
release lock after the that period (or maximum value, which configured
on the server). Other threads can still run `get` queries queries
against the document, but mutation operations without a CAS will fail.

You can determine actual default and maximum values calling
`Bucket#stats` without arguments and inspecting keys
`"ep_getl_default_timeout"` and `"ep_getl_max_timeout"`
correspondingly.

[source,ruby]
----
key = "eagle_brewing-golden";

# Get with Lock
beer, flags, cas = client.get(key, :lock => true, :extended => true);

# Update the document
beer["name"] = "Some other Name"

# Try to set without the lock
client.set(key, beer, :flags => flags)
#=> will raise Couchbase::Error::KeyExists

# Try to set with the CAS aquired, will be OK
client.set(key, beer, :flags => flags, :cas => cas)
----

Once you update the document, the lock will be released. There is also
the `Bucket#unlock` method available through which you can unlock the
document.

=== Persistence and Replication

By default, the mutation operations return when Couchbase Server has
accepted the command and stored it in memory (disk persistence and
replication is handled asynchronously by the cluster). That's one of
the reason why it's so fast. For most use-cases, that's the behavior
that you need. Sometimes though, you want to trade in performance for
data-safety and wait until the document has been saved to disk and/or
replicated to other hosts.

The Ruby SDK provides `:observe` option for all mutation operations.
You can claim various persistence conditions using this option.
Basically its argument is a Hash with three possible keys, describing
the condition when the mutator will yield the result:

. `:replicated` (Fixnum) describe how many nodes should receive
replicated copy of the document.

. `:persisted` (Fixnum) describe how many nodes should persist the
document to the disk. The nodes include master node, where the key
resides and all replica nodes.

. `:timeout` (Fixnum) the timeout period in microseconds. After
passing, the operation condition will be considered timed out and
appropriate exception will be thrown. Default value could be addressed
using `Bucket#default_observe_timeout`.

Here is an example on how to make sure that the document has been
persisted on its master node, but also replicated to at least one of
its replicas.

[source,ruby]
----
key = "important"
value = "document"
client.set(key, value, :observe => {:persisted => 1, :replicated => 1})
----

You can also separate persistence requirement from actual operations,
and in this case, you can wait for several keys:

[source,ruby]
----
keys = []
(1..5).each do |nn|
  key = "important-#{nn}"
  keys << key
  client.set(key, "document-#{nn}")
end
client.observe_and_wait(keys, :persisted => 1, :replicated => 1)
----
